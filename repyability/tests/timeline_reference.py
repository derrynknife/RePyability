    """Merge two up/down timelines and count how many are up over time.

    Each timeline is a list of ``(time, change)`` pairs, as the
    availability simulation records them for a node and for the system: a
    first entry ``(0.0, 1)`` if it starts up or ``(0.0, 0)`` if it starts
    down, then ``(t, 1)`` for each restoration and ``(t, -1)`` for each
    failure, and a last entry ``(t_end, 0)`` closing the window. The
    changes of the two timelines are summed at equal times and accumulated
    in time order.

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeline_1 : list[tuple[float, int]]
        The first timeline, e.g. a node's.
    timeline_2 : list[tuple[float, int]]

        of the two (0, 1 or 2) that are up from that time until the next.

    --------
    A node down on ``[2, 3)`` and a system down on ``[2, 5)``, over a
