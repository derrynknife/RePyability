## [Unreleased]

This release focuses on packaging, tooling, correctness and API-consistency
foundations (Phases 0 and 1 of the development plan in
`docs/REVIEW_AND_ROADMAP.md`).

### Added
- **Installable packaging.** `pyproject.toml` now declares a PEP 621
  `[project]` table and a `[build-system]`, so the package builds and installs
  from source (`pip install .`) with correct name, version and dependencies.
  Version is sourced from `repyability/_version.py`.
- **`scipy` and `joblib` dependencies** are now declared (both were required at
  runtime — `scipy` directly, `joblib` transitively via surpyval — but
  undeclared).
- **Optional dependency groups**: `.[dev]` (pinned tooling) and `.[docs]`.
- **Seedable Monte-Carlo.** Simulation entry points accept a `seed=`
  argument (`NonRepairableRBD.random/mean/mean_time_to_failure/node_mttf`,
  `RepairableRBD.availability`, `StandbyModel`, `RepeatedNode`,
  `RepeatedStandbyNode`). Seeding is reproducible and restores the caller's
  global RNG state afterwards.
- **System-level `df` (failure density), `hf` (hazard rate) and `Hf`
  (cumulative hazard)** on `NonRepairableRBD`.
- **Curated public API.** Common classes are re-exported from the top-level
  package (`from repyability import NonRepairableRBD, StandbyModel, ...`) and
  listed in `__all__`. `repyability.__version__` is available.
- **`NonRepairableRBD.is_fixed`** property.
- CI now runs a lint/type gate and a test matrix (Python 3.10–3.12) with a
  coverage `fail_under` gate; a release workflow publishes to PyPI via trusted
  publishing.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and issue/PR templates.

### Changed
- **`fussel_vesely` → `fussell_vesely`** (corrected Fussell-Vesely spelling).
  The old name remains as a deprecated alias that emits a `DeprecationWarning`.
- Reliability-model dispatch no longer branches on surpyval `dist.name` string
  literals scattered across modules; it goes through capability helpers
  (`repyability/rbd/_model_utils.py`), covered by a surpyval-compatibility
  test.
- `requirements.txt` / `requirements_dev.txt` now install the package and its
  (pinned) extras from `pyproject.toml`, removing the previous mismatch where
  dev pulled surpyval from git HEAD while runtime pinned a release.
- Coverage now measures the library only (tests omitted) and enforces a
  `fail_under` threshold.
- Requires Python >= 3.10.

### Fixed
- Removed a stray debug `print()` in `RBD.improvement_allocation`.
- Replaced `type(x) == Cls` checks with `isinstance` in `NonRepairable`.
- Replaced mutable default arguments (`{}`, `[]`) with `None` sentinels.
- Removed cross-instance access to a name-mangled attribute (`__fixed_probs`).
- **`working_nodes`/`broken_nodes` ("force node working/failed") logic:**
  - `RepairableRBD.availability()` no longer crashes with `ZeroDivisionError`
    (and the operational/IOU criticality indices no longer return `NaN`) when
    a simulation records zero system failures/restorations — e.g. when a
    redundant node is forced working. Zero-exposure measures return 0.
  - A component forced broken in `availability()` is now accounted as **down**
    from t=0 (its uptime and the initial system state were previously assumed
    "up", so a broken component reported full uptime and a system it kept down
    was over-counted as available at the start).
  - `working_nodes`/`broken_nodes` now **raise** on invalid input instead of
    silently ignoring it: unknown node names, the input/output node, or the
    same node in both sets. Previously a typo silently returned a
    plausible-but-wrong result.
  - Setting a repeated node broken now raises the same error as setting it
    working (previously it was silently ignored — an asymmetry).

### Removed
- Dead/unused `repyability/rbd/rbd_args_check.py` module and the never-
  implemented `working_components`/`broken_components` parameters that its
  (commented-out) check referenced in `sf()`'s docstring.

### Deprecated
- `NonRepairableRBD.fussel_vesely` / `RepairableRBD.fussel_vesely` (use
  `fussell_vesely`).
