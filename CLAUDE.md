# RePyability — project notes for Claude

## Architecture & scope

- **Distribution/lifetime fitting stays in surpyval, not RePyability.** surpyval
  (same maintainer) owns fitting failure/event data to distributions.
  RePyability *consumes* already-fitted surpyval models (and equivalents) as
  RBD node inputs; it does not implement its own data-fitting APIs. When a
  "from data to system reliability" workflow is wanted, do the fitting in
  surpyval and pass the resulting models in — do not add fitting logic here.

- **Visualization stays out of RePyability.** The Reliafy app (separate,
  open source) handles plotting/dashboards/reporting. RePyability is the
  computational reliability engine; keep it free of plotting dependencies.
